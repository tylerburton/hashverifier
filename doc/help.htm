The Hash Verifier program allows the user to generate the hashes of specified files. This in turn allows the user to verify the integrity of their files from corruption or change.
</p>
<p>
<a name="basic_use"><h2>Basic Use</h2></a>
The easiest way to use the program is to drag files from your file browser into the file list of the program. Alternatively you can use the File menu to add single files ("File->Select File" or "Ctrl+O") or whole directories ("File->Select Directory" or "Ctrl+D").<br /><br />

Once within the file list you simply need to click on the file path and it will show you the produced hash below in hex-string form. If you need to use an alternative hash function, the default being MD5, simply change it in the combo box and watch as the change is reflected.
</p>

<a name="comparing_hashes"><h2>Comparing Hashes</h2></a>
A very useful feature of this program is to compare the generated file hashes against those provided from the original software distributor or from your own personal records. This allows you to verify that the file is not corrupt and, assuming you received the known hashes in a verifiable way, that the file has not been altered. To do this simply copy and paste or type the known hash string into the text field at the bottom of the program.<br /><br />

As you can see in the image above the produced hash does not match the provided hash and thus either the file has changed or has been corrupted.<br /><br />

In this example we can see that the produced hash does match the provided hash and thus the file's integrity has been verified!
</p>

<a name="export_feature"><h2>Export Feature</h2></a>
The program also features a handy export feature which will take the currently selected file, or all files depending on the mode clicked, and write these hashes to a single text file. This can be then kept for your own personal records or provided to end users as a way to ensure that the files have not been corrupted.<br /><br />
